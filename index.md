# Welcome to Snowden!
Snowden is a general use discord bot with some funny quirks and commands.  
for instance: 
- can post random cat facts using an API.
- can find random wikipidia posts and post them in the chat.
- can repeat something from a person like a @person (works perfectly if you require someone's attention).
- can send eyes in chat. ðŸ‘€
- can send it's own ping to show lag.

## Why would you use Snowden?

Don't know, maybe you're a masochist?

## Why is he named Snowden?

Asked my mom what would be a call name for a robot and she was totally ignoring my question while ranting about [Edward Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden).
